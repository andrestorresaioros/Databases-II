##  AgroClima: A Smart Agro-Climatic Decision Support Platform

---

## Introduction to the Business Model

AgroClima is a smart agro-climatic decision support platform designed to provide advanced climate-based solutions for farmers and agricultural organizations. The core idea is to leverage climate data and artificial intelligence tools to deliver accurate and timely recommendations that enhance agricultural decision-making in the face of adverse weather conditions.

The platform addresses the high vulnerability of the agricultural sector to extreme weather events such as droughts, frosts, and heavy rainfall, which result in substantial crop losses, reduced productivity, and threats to food security. Currently, many farmers lack effective and accessible tools to anticipate and adapt to these challenges.

The final product is a user-friendly web platform adapted for rural areas with limited connectivity. It will deliver personalized alerts, agricultural management recommendations, and optimized resource strategies (water, fertilizers), while providing institutions with access to regional climate risk information.

## 🗂️ Initial Database Architecture

The system was modeled using a 10-step methodology to design entities, attributes, and relationships.

### Main Entities
- `User`, `Agriculture_Field`, `Crop`, `Location`, `Prediction`, `Alert`, `Recommendation`, `Weather_Station`, `Weather_Data`, `Event_Type`, `Severity_Level`, `Model`, `Data_Source`

### Relationships
- 1:N — User → Fields, Alerts  
- 1:N — Prediction → Alerts, Recommendations  
- N:M — Weather Station ↔ Data Source (handled via associative entity)

### Key Features
- Role-based access
- Geographic linkage of fields and weather stations
- Trackable predictions and alerts
- Modular and scalable schema

## **Information Requirements**

The platform must support the retrieval and storage of:

- **User Profiles & Roles**: Role-based access, associated fields and preferences.
- **Climate Predictions**: Events, probabilities, severity, timestamps, model IDs.
- **Recommendations**: Linked to predictions, personalized to user and crop.
- **Weather Data**: Timestamped records from stations and locations.
- **Agricultural Fields**: Geolocation, crop type, ownership.
- **Alerts**: Delivery tracking and alert history per user.
- **API Raw Responses**: Stored in MongoDB for debugging and model validation.
- **Interaction Logs**: Logs of usage patterns and feedback for UX and analytics.

WHERE u.user_id = 1
ORDER BY p.timestamp DESC;
```

### Last 24h Weather Data

SELECT wd.timestamp, wd.temperature, wd.humidity, ws.station_name, l.name AS location
FROM Weather_Data wd
JOIN Weather_Station ws ON wd.station_id = ws.station_id
JOIN Location l ON ws.location_id = l.location_id
WHERE wd.timestamp BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '1 DAY' AND NOW();
```

### Alerts Received by User
```sql
SELECT u.user_name, e.event_name, a.status, a.timestamp_sent
FROM Alert a
JOIN User u ON a.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Prediction p ON a.prediction_id = p.prediction_id
JOIN Event_type e ON p.event_type_id = e.event_type_id
WHERE u.user_id = 1
ORDER BY a.timestamp_sent DESC;
```

### MongoDB - User Interaction Log (Latest 5)
```javascript
db.interaction_logs.find({
  interaction_type: "recommendation_viewed",
  user_id: "u001"
}).sort({ timestamp: -1 }).limit(5);
```

### MongoDB - Raw API Responses
```javascript
db.api_responses.find({
  source: "OpenWeather",
  "location.name": "Cali",
  timestamp: { $gte: ISODate("2025-05-27T00:00:00Z") }
}).sort({ timestamp: -1 }).limit(10);
```
